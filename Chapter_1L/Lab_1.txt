Files used: Lab01-01.exe, Lab01-01.dll
Questions

1. Upload the files to VirusTotal and view the reports. Does either file match any existing antivirus signatures?
A: Lab01-01.exe 54 security vendors and 1 sandbox flagged this file as malicious. Both files are likely to be malicious according to VT.
S:As of the time of the publication of the book, there should be no results, but that is subject to change

2. When were these files compiled?
A: Lab01-01.exe - 2010/12/19 Sunday 16:16:19 UTC. Lab01-01.dll - 2010/12/19 Sun 16:16:38. Lab01-01.dll 45 security vendors and no sandboxes flagged this file as malicious. 
S: December 19, 2010 within a minute of each other

3. Are there any indications that either of these files is packed or obfuscated? If so what are these indicators?
A. No indication that Lab01-01.exe or Lab01-01.dll is packed given the Virtual Size is less than the Actual Size.
S: No indication that either file is packed or obfuscated

4. Do any imports hint at what this malware does? If so, which imports are they?
A. 
Lab01-01.exe
CopyFile
CreateFile
CreateFileMapping
FindFirstFile/FindNextFile
  Used to search through a directory and enumerate the filesystem
MapViewOfFile
  Maps a file into memory and makes the contents of the file accessible via memory addresses. Used by launchers, loaders and injectors. Can be used to avoid using WriteFile to modify the contents of a file. 
UnmapViewOfFile
Lab01-01.dll
CreateMutex
  Creates a mutual exclusion object that can be used by malware to ensure that only a single instance of the malware is running on a system at any given time. Malware often uses fixed names for mutexes, which can be good host-based indicators to detect additional installations of the malware. 
CreateProcess
OpenMutex

S: 
Lab01-01.exe
FindFirstFile/FindNextFile
CopyFile
These imports tell us that the program searches the file system and copies files. 
Lab01-01.dll
CreateProcess
Sleep
Imports functions from WS2_32.dll which provides network functionality

5. Are there any other files or host-based indicators that you could look for on infected systems?
A: Given the CreateMutex function in the .dll I could look for the fixed name for the mutual exclusion object to check for additional installations of the malware. Could also look for new files created by Lab01-01.exe given it's use of the CreateFile function as well as new copies of the file as it looks like the functions can be used to proliferate the program through a file system. 

6. What network-based indicators could be used to find this malware on infected machines?
A: Potential network-based indicators include unusual traffic over the network that doesn't match usual activity, download of new external files, and a proliferation of the same file across the network

7. What would you guess is the purpose of these files?
A: Given the ability of these files to Create Files, map files into memory, create processes, and enumerate/search through a filesystem, I guess these files are an injector/launcher/loader that also has the ability to copy itself and spread throughout the file system and/or network.
